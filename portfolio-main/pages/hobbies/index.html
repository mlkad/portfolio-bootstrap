          <h3>Debates</h3>
          <p class = 'hobbie-description'>Debating challenges me to think critically and express my ideas clearly and persuasively. I love engaging
            in discussions because it pushes me to understand different perspectives, sharpen my reasoning, and defend
            my stance with logical arguments. It’s not just about winning, but about learning and refining the art of
            communication. Debates fuel my passion for knowledge and keep my mind sharp and active.</p>

          <h3>Hackatons</h3>
          <p class = 'hobbie-description'>Participating in hackathons pushes me to solve challenging problems under tight deadlines. It’s a
            high-energy, creative space where I can apply and improve my coding skills, collaborate with others, and
            build innovative projects quickly. I enjoy the thrill of transforming ideas into working solutions in a
            fast-paced environment, and the competitive yet collaborative atmosphere always leaves me motivated.

          <h3>Gym</h3>
          <p class = 'hobbie-description'>Going to the gym is more than just staying fit; it’s about personal discipline, growth, and mental clarity.
            I enjoy challenging myself physically because it gives me a sense of accomplishment and balance. The routine
            of lifting weights or doing cardio keeps me energized and focused, while also helping me relieve stress. I
            love how the gym teaches resilience and pushes me to be my best self, both physically and mentally.</p>
